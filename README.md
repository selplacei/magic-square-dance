# magic-square-dance

This program is a visual representation of the "Magic Square Dance" algorithm used to construct all tilings of an Aztec Board, as described in this Mathologer video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7Q8IWNfHM

I'm not a mathematician, just thought this would be a fun program to make.

## How to run this program

Install Python (make sure it's Python 3.8 or later)  
Open a terminal (command prompt) and run `pip install PySide2` (if you'd like to use a venv etc. you already know what you're doing)  
Download this repository  
Launch `main.py` (if this opens a text editor, specify Python as the application)
